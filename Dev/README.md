This is for code for changes or things in working progress I will add as I can, this isn't for public use and any changes other than those who are
assigned (If you help me) will be denied any pull requests. 

#Archives 

The <a href="https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsMightCalculator/tree/master/Dev/Archives">Archives</a> folder has the old versions of the dev. versions, most of these weren't released, or were and now there is a newer version.
