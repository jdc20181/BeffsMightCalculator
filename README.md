#Working with BeffsMightCalculator

I have created (With the help of a tutorial!) A way for you to edit BMC and make your changes and preview them! 
That can be found at http://www.beffsmc.beffsbrowser.tk/editor.html
Then, when you made and preview changes you can contact me by using the contact form at the bottom of the BMC site (http://beffsmc.beffsbrowser.tk) with your changes!
