#Working with BMC

BMC is written in Javascript and some html. The mobile version is still in JS but has jQuery Mobile as the base, with some html. 

To make BMC better you need to understand the basics of html and JS as well as some jQuery Mobile. You can use one of the links below to 
guide you on how to work with these languages.

#Coding BMC

When you work on coding BMC it is important to keep it in Js, the HTML files are the files that hold the content of the website. 
The JS functions are simply part of the document. 

With the mobile version keep in mind it is a *Mobile Version* and that anythign you do needs to be matching with jQuery Mobile style.

You can use the editor adopted from another site at http://beffsmc.beffsbrowser.tk/editor.html

#Issues

Bugs are common and a expected part of development, if you can I ask before you innovate any of the code, squish bugs first. 
The improvments or changes will be directed by myself, or a trusted team member. 

#Submitting patches
Most of the time your patch will most likely be denied. But don't run away, as I said the development is open, but I really ask you help with bugs
as that is what needs to be helped with. If we have everyone who contributes adding major code changes bugs can't be seen at code level. But
if you are only working on bugs, then you can find and help fix them. 


#Thank you!
