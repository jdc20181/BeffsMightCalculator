BeffsMightCalculator V. 0.2.1 


There are plenty of changes to be made for V. 0.2.1 and many things that I will note in this change log you may want to take note of. 


First off, the Program version, where you install to your windows computer is going to be migrated into a web-based app. This change provides a good way to reach all Hobbit-Players and devices. 

I will be introducing all troops, and many more increments (20k 100k 300k 500k 1m) So, if for example you're in a TOM then, you can see how much you will gain by training this many troops. 

Policy Additions. 

There are a few policy adaptations that must occur when The V. 0.2.1 is launched, and that is a policy that will be set for the use of BeffsMightCalculator. With some recent game changes, and policy changes, I must adapt those into BMC to disclaim any warrants or things not to do with BMC. 

That policy will be displayed once it is completed. 


Other changes. 

The website where the new web-app version of BMC will be located at will be easy to use, and the version, change log, and other information will be reachable from the new site.
